# Welcome to **SimProp** documentation

## About

**SimProp** is a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation code developed for the propagation of ultra-high energy (UHE) particles (protons and nuclei) through astrophysical backgrounds. In designing such a code, we have focused on a tool which can provide a fast and reliable analysis of the predictions on the spectrum and chemical composition.

The computational scheme to propagate charged particles in SimProp is based on the kinetic approach proposed by [1] [Aloisio+2020](). 

The main ingredients of this method are:

* the continuous energy loss (CEL) approximation and 

* the assumption of an exact con- servation of the particleâ€™s Lorentz factor in the photo- disintegration process 

## Latest version

The first version of the code (v2r0) was publicily released in May 2012. The current version is (v2r?) and can be found on a github [repository](https://github.com/carmeloevoli/SimProp-beta)
