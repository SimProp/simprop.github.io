# Welcome to **SimProp** documentation

## About

**SimProp** is a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation code developed for the propagation of ultra-high energy (UHE) particles (protons and nuclei) through astrophysical backgrounds. In designing such a code, we have focused on a tool which can provide a fast and reliable analysis of the predictions on the spectrum and chemical composition.

The computational scheme to propagate charged particles in SimProp is based on the kinetic approach proposed by [Aloisio et al., 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013APh....41...73A). 

The main physical processes taken into account are:

* the continuous energy loss of...

* the photo-disintegration process...

* the photo-pion production...

## Latest version

The first version of the code (v2r0) was publicily released in May 2012. The current version is (v2r?) and can be found on a github [repository](https://github.com/carmeloevoli/SimProp-beta)
