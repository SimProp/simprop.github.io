In designing such a code, we have focused on a tool which can provide a fast and reliable analysis of the predictions on the spectrum and chemical composition. The computational scheme to propagate charged particles in SimProp is based on the kinetic approach proposed by Aloisio et al., 2013 . The main physical processes taken into account are: the continuous energy loss of... the photo-disintegration process... the photo-pion production...
